##  the HDR model
> the HDR will not be able to upload to this github due to  its heavy weight.
If you want to use the function Load bitmap + new model,  uncomment rows 309-345 (// // // Loader model without HDR)
then:
1. First you need to install some light source before hand. for this [link](https://app.gumroad.com/d/f787375986bcd37d3875b37f04cc635d) and download the `MR_INT-001_NaturalStudio_NAD` file.
2. Then put that file into the static folder after you clone this repo.
3. uncomment the HDR part.
